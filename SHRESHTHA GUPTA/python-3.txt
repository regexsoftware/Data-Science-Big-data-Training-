ASSIGNMENT-3(PYTHON)

Q1.Find the Armstrong Number between the two numbers which are input by user.

Ans.
lower = int(input("Enter lower range: "))
upper = int(input("Enter upper range: "))
 
for num in range(lower,upper + 1):

   sum = 0
 
   temp = num
   while temp > 0:
       digit = temp % 10
       sum += digit ** 3
       temp //= 10
 
   if num == sum:
       print(num)

Q2.Let’s say you have a string “hello this world @2020!!! ”
Remove the punctuation like [“@!#$%&*()”] from the string
Final output should be without the punctuation
“hello this world 2020”.

Ans.

punctuations = '''!()-[]{};:'"\,<>./?@#$%^&*_~'''
str = "hello this world @2020!!!"
new= ""
for char in str:
   if char not in punctuations:
       new= new + char

print(new)  

Q3.You have a list with words - [“Apple”, “banana”, “cat”, “REGEX”,”apple”]
Sort words in Alphabetical order.
If you get output, like [Apple, apple, banana]
How has it happened?

Ans.

a = ["Apple", "banana", "cat", "REGEX","apple"]

x = sorted(a , key=str.lower)

print(x)

This will give us output:
['Apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'cat', 'REGEX']
diregarding the capitalization in the list objects by using key function.
