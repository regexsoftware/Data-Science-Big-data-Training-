PYTHON ASSIGNMENT-5

Q1.Hint:
-> Make a use of Time Module and for Loop.
-> Output Should be :
Loading.
Loading..
Loading...
Loading....
Loading.....
Here it shows you 5 output but you have to print only "Loading....." in animated
form.

Ans.

import time
for i in range(10):
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Loading....")


Q2.Difference between yield and return?
Ans.The yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state
to enable function to resume where it is left off.When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after 
the last yield run.This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at 
once and sending them back like a list.

Return sends a specified value back to its caller whereas Yield can produce a sequence of values. We should use 
yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but don’t want to store the entire sequence in memory.


Q3.Make digital Clock and run it for 5 sec.
Output:
16:39:08
     :09
     :10
     :11
     :12

Ans.
import time
for i in range(5):
    time.sleep(1)
    current_time = time.ctime()
    time_format = current_time[11:19]
    print(time_format)


Q4.Add anything in tuple.example: (1,2,3,4) -> new tuple (1,2,3,4,5)

Ans.
my_tuple = (1,2,3,4)
my_list = list(my_tuple)
my_list.append(5)
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print(my_tuple)

Q5.WhatsApp texting using webbrowser Lib.

Ans.
import webbrowser
import time
import datetime

name = input('Enter the contact number of a person you want to send message in WhatsApp: ')
message = input('Enter the message: ')
time1 = input('Enter time in {hh:mm:ss} format: ')
print(f'Time entered by user: {time1}')
while True:
    current_time = time.ctime()
    time_format = current_time[11:19]
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f'Current time: {time_format}')
    if time1 == time_format:
        webbrowser.open_new_tab(f'https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+91{name}&text={message}')
        print(message)
        break
    elif time1 < time_format:
        print('Enter correct time')
        break
    else:
        print('waiting..')
