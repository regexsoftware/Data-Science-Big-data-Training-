Ques 2: You have to list all files and subfolders and view them in human readable form. Make sure to give the location of parent /regex .
Ans 2:  hdfs dfs –ls –h /regex


Ques 3: Write a command to see the disk usage of all the replicas used.
Ans 3: You can check the free space in an HDFS directory with a couple of commands. The -df command shows the configured capacity, available free space and used space of a file system in HDFS.
	$ hdfs dfs -df
	
	You can specify the –h option with the df command for more readable and concise output:
	$ hdfs dfs -df -h

	You can view the used storage in the entire HDFS file system with the following command:
	$ hdfs dfs -du /


Ques 4: Remove some file using rm -r  (You will see moving them to trash) . Again remove the files so that it will delete without moving into trash.
Ans 4:    $hdfs dfs –rm –r /regex/file.txt

                $hdfs dfs –rm –skipTrash /regex/file.txt


Ques 5: Retrive the files from hadoop file system location to your localfile system.
Ans 5:    $hdfs dfs –copyToLocal /regex/hello.txt


Ques 6: By default replication factor in hdfs is 3. If you want to change the replication factor to 5 at the time of putting the files. How will you do it?
Ans 6:   $hdfs dfs –setrep –w 5 /regex/yo.txt  

Ques 7: Suppose you  have a file and your metadata is stored in namenode. You have to find the location , blocks , filename of the file.
Ans 7:   $hdfs dfsadmin -report
	      or
              $bin dfsadmin -report
