Ques 1: What is JPython & CPython?
Ans: JPython: Jython is the JVM implementation of the Python programming language. 
	      It is designed to run on the Java platform.
              A Jython program can import and use any Java class. 
	      Just as Java, Jython program compiles to bytecode. 
              One of the main advantages is that a user interface designed in Python can use GUI elements of AWT, Swing or SWT Package.
	      Jython, which started as JPython and was later renamed, follows closely the standard Python implementation called CPython as created by Guido Van Rossum.
     CPython: CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. 
	      Written in C and Python, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.
	      CPython can be defined as both an interpreter and a compiler as it compiles Python code into bytecode before interpreting it.
              It has a foreign function interface with several languages including C, in which one must explicitly write bindings in a language other than Python.

Ques 2: Basic difference between Python2 and Python3?
Ans: Basis of comparison	Python 3	Python 2
	Release Date		2008		2000
	Function print		print ("hello")	print "hello"
	Syntax			simpler         comparatively difficult to understand
	Iteration       	Range() func.	xrange() is used for iterations.

Ques 3: Difference between ASCII and Unicode?
Ans: ASCII: It stands for American Standart Code for Information Interchange. It uses 8-bit encoding.
	    ASCII represents 128 characters.
	    It is stored as 8-bit byte.
	    ASCII is not standardized.

     Unicode: It is also a character encoding but uses variable bit encoding.
	      Unicode defones 2^21 characters. Unicode is a superset of ASCII. It represents more characters than ASCII.
	      Unicode is stored in byte sequences such as UTF-32 and UTF-8.
	      Unicode is standardized.
