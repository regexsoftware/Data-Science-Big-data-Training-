Q) Difference between Return and Yield ?

return: * it sends a specified value back to its caller
        * causes a function to exit
        * terminates the execution of a function & destroys local variables

yield:  * used to define generators
        * replaces the return value of a function to suspend its execution without
        destroying the local variables
        * used when the generator returns an intermediate result to caller
